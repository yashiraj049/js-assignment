Question 2.: What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types with examples.

Solution: In JavaScript, data types refer to the different types of values that can be assigned to variables. JavaScript has both primitive data types and non-primitive data types (also known as reference types).

Primitive Data Types
1. Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

let age = 25; // integer
let height = 5.5; // floating-point number


2. String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as text or a sentence.

let name = 'John Doe';
let message = "Hello, world!";


3. Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.

let isAdmin = true;
let isGuest = false;


4. Null: Represents the absence of any object value.

let emptyValue = null;


5. Undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable or a non-existent property.

let uninitializedVariable;
console.log(uninitializedVariable); // outputs: undefined


Non -primitive Data Types
1. Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be any data type.

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 25,
  isAdmin: true
};


2. Array: Represents an ordered collection of values, which can be of any data type.

let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];


Special Data Types
1. Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as property keys in objects.

let uniqueKey = Symbol('uniqueKey');
let obj = {[uniqueKey]: 'value'};


2. BigInt: Represents a large integer value, larger than the maximum limit of the Number data type.

let largeNumber = 12345678901234567890n;


These are the main data types in JavaScript. Understanding these data types is essential for working with variables, operators, and control structures in JavaScript.
